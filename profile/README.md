Welcome to Unstructured Technologies! We're delivering the first ever open-source toolkit
designed to make it easy to prepare unstructured data like PDFs, HTML and Word Documents
for downstream data science tasks. Check out our core repos:

- [`unstructured`](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured) - Core library with
  pre-processing components for unstructured data across various document types.
- [`unstructured-api`](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured-api) - Project that provides
  `unstructured`'s core partitioning capability as an API, able to process many types of raw documents.
- [`unstructured-inference`](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured-inference) - Everything related to ML inferences, supporting the `unstructured` library.

See [`community`](https://github.com/Unstructuâ€ red-IO/community) for more general documentation about pipeline- family API's and contributing across all Unstructured's repos.
