## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a security vulnerability in one of our projects, email us at [security@unstructured.io](mailto:security@unstructured.io?subject=Security%20Vulnerability%20Report) with the subject line "Security Vulnerability Report". We will respond within 72 hours with a decision on whether your security report is accepted or declined. Please don't open an issue yourself. We will open an issue if your vulnerability is accepted. The issue will not be public to avoid publicizing the vulnerability. We will let you know when the reported vulnerability is fixed or mitigated.
